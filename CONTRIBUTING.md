# Contributing to Exosite's Documentation

Thanks for helping make docs better!  Check out the [Documentation Categories](#documentation-categories) and [Technical Overview](#technical-overview) below for information on how this doc site works and how to use the tools to contribute to it. 

## Making Small Changes

If you are just adjusting a simple spelling error or syntax/grammar problem, you can edit the page directly in the GitHub UI (go to the doc page and click the pencil edit button). Any changes you make with this method should be minor!

## Making Large(r) Changes

If you are making more significant changes, you will need to make the changes locally, verify they are complete and accurate, push the changes to GitHub on a branch, and then submit a pull request to get them published.  Details below:

First, you will need to read the section below on ["Developing"](#developing) to get this docs repository cloned onto your local machine and to be able to preview changes before pushing back to GitHub.

Before starting to make changes, get the most recent GitHub version of docs down via "git pull" and then create a branch (e.g., my-branch-name) via "git branch my-branch-name".  Check out the branch via "git checkout my-branch-name" and then make your changes.

Once you have made changes you are happy with locally and have committed those changes to your "my-branch-name" branch, go ahead and push the branch via "git push origin my-branch-name".  Then, in GitHub, go ahead and submit a pull request so that the documentation overlord can review your changes and determine if they are ready for prime time or not.

To submit a pull request in github, go to the <a href="https://github.com/exosite/docs/pulls">Pull requests menu item</a> and click "New pull request", set base to "master" and compare to "my-branch-name" and click "Create pull request".

## Documentation Categories

### Informational Overview

A page that provides a high-level overview of a subject and introduces the main components (e.g., "Welcome to Murano" - http://docs.exosite.com/).

### Quickstart

Quickstarts walk users through the shortest possible way to accomplish something in the format of a tutorial (e.g., "Lightbulb Quickstart" - http://docs.exosite.com/quickstarts/lightbulb/).

### Guide

Guides are brief examples of how to do a single specific task, such as sending a notification (e.g., "Create a Product" - http://docs.exosite.com/guides/create-product/).

### Tutorial

Tutorials provide users with a complete example of how to implement a full solution from end to end by walking through real-life use cases in great detail (e.g., "HVAC Tutorial" - http://docs.exosite.com/tutorials/hvac-tutorial/).

### Reference

Reference docs provide developers with the API, code, and other technical resources they may need to accomplish specific tasks. 

## Technical Overview

Exosite's docs site is hosted on Github Pages, this means that it is just a bunch
of static HTML files. To make the docs easier to write, this repo includes a
custom static site generator that reads markdown and transforms it into HTML.

### Directory Structure

When the site generator runs it will ingest all the markdown files, convert them
to HTML, apply the site template, and save the file with the same name, changing
the extension from `.md` to `.html`.

In an effort to make the doc readable both on the generated site and directly in
the GitHub web interface most pages should be named README.md. The site
generator will save the generated HTML from any README.md file into an
index.html file. This means that, for instance, the RPC doc, `/rpc/README.md`
will generate the page `/rpc/index.html` which can then be viewed at
[Portals RPC Documentation](/portals/rpc)

In addition to markdown files the generator will copy all .html, .png, and .jpg
files in place.

### Frontmatter

Both markdown files and HTML files can contain frontmatter. Frontmatter is
basically a set of variables that the generator uses to change exactly how it
processes the file. It must be the first thing in the file and be formatted
like:

```
---
title: Introduction
template: default
---
```

There are two variables that are currently supported. `title` is used to set the
HTML title tag in the template. `template` is used to set the HTML template that
is used, it can be "default" (which is the default).

Frontmatter is optional.

## Developing

First step is to get the documentation files on your local machine!  The best
way to do that is to us git and clone the documentation repository from 
github.  

If you don't know how to use git, see the <a href="https://i.exosite.com/display/ENG/GIT+Usage+Guide">in-house tutorial</a>, go get a github account, and work 
with the documentation team to get your user added to the github documentation 
project.  Once you do that, you can open a command line, and clone the 
repository onto your local machine via git clone (for example: git clone 
https://github.com/exosite/docs.git).  If you are working on a branch, make 
sure to switch to that branch before editing files...

### Local Preview

When making changes that are more substantial than a technical or grammar fix
you'll probably want to fix preview your changes locally. You'll need three
tools to generate the site, Node.js, Node Package Manager, and Gulp.

Use your platform's tools to install Node and NPM, on OSX this can be done with:

```
brew install npm
```

Then install gulp globally with

```
npm install -g gulp
```

To actually build the site, first install the dependencies with 

```
npm install
```

and finally build the site with 

```
gulp
```

You can also startup a local server to see your changes in the browser with

```
gulp serve
```

### Markdown Suggestions for Local vs. Github/Published Idiosyncracies

* **Images**:
 * For images you don't need to resize, use the format: `![Image Reference](/fullpath/image.png)`
 * For images you need to resize, use the format:`<img src="/fullpath/image.png" height="200" alt="Image Reference">`
 * You have to use the full path from the base of the docs folder (e.g. /guides/assets/imagename.png) for both your local and github to render properly (local will render with a relative path but github will not)
 
* **Links that Work on https://docs.exosite.com but not on Local**
 * Some docs are created from developer documentation.  These docs are replaced when the docs site is pushed live per https://github.com/exosite/docs/blob/master/fetch_svc_docs.sh .
  * This includes all information, for example, under /reference/services
